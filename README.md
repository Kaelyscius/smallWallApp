# smallWallApp

SmallWallApp is a little simplistic application that create a wall or users can leave messages.

It's just a little exercise, there remain many things to improve.

But the basis of the application will be used again to probably make a small framework.

The architecture of this application is in MVC, only there is not yet a true independent router system.
